# Philip King

Hey, I'm a Software Developer.

I have a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Texas and have been programming for 5 years, both professionally and for fun.

Some of the strongest tools in my kit are JavaScript, React, HTML & CSS. I have experimented with the other big frameworks like Angular 2 and Vue.js but I will probably
stick with React as my main tool for now. Aside from the Front-End stuff, I also have experience with Node.js, SQL and NoSQL, and REST APIs. I have used plenty of 3rd
party APIs and have made my own for my projects. I am very interested in the concept of scaling an application from 0-100 by myself, and by that I mean that I have been focused on how to build out the front and back-end, design, create assets, and host. For some projects in the past I have spun up my own servers using old PC's and
Ubuntu, although now I am a fan of serverless options like AWS. I think that Next.js and serverless webpages are cutting edge tech, with the way search engines are now,
SEO is more important than ever.

I have just recently begun to delve into the depths of Web3, AI, and cybersecurity. These three fields interest me a lot and I plan to pursue courses for each. 

This is my website and I want it to be a place where I can be myself. I don't want to be all anxious about how I write and my grammar and spelling, so I am taking 
things fast and loose with this site. 

This portfolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), and is hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs).
