# Blockchain: Initial Impressions

This one I'm writing myself, unlike the AI article from last month. I have recently been looking into Web3 seriously for the first time since it became a thing.
I must confess that with no investigation I thought it sounded like bullshit- just some buzzword tech nonsense to fool venture capitalists. And to be fair,
a lot of people have already been scammed from Web3 scams. Anyways, just so we are on the same page, this is what Web3 is defined as:

> Web3 has become a catch-all term for the vision of a new, better internet. At its core, 
> Web3 uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership.
> A 2020 [post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/himgajria/status/1266415636789334016) said it best: Web1 was read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 will be read-write-own.

This quote is directly from https://ethereum.org/en/web3/, where it also says that the founder of Ethereum, Gavin Wood, coined the term. You should probably read that
whole article they have about web3.

## Ownership

Theres definitely a problem with the amount of power of Big Tech companies and something does need to be done. However, I don't see how blockchain can solve this.
If somehow ownership was able to be managed with nft's and a platform shutting down didn't mean you lose all your content- what about the ISPs? Maybe there are 
already people working on this issue. I know there have been a couple peer-to-peer internet experiments but I don't know if any have gained a large following. 
It hardly matters who 'owns' what when the internet can be shut off at the source. 

## DAOs

This part gets me quite excited. This may be the best application of blockchain so far. There are a lot of problems with democracy and voting so being able
to assign one vote to one person in such a rigid and transparent way is immensely beneficial. Transparency is especially important to foster trust and prevent
corruption. I don't know if this would work but if the blockchain could manage a budget and keep track of every single cent and where it goes... that could also be
incredibly useful. 

I think a lot of projects in this Web3 sphere are stupid and useless, like NFT pictures of monkeys. But just because some opportunists see a way to make money in the
confusion of a new technology doesnt mean it can be a good tool. I actually have recently become involved in a DAO and have been looking into Buildspace.so to learn
what I am getting involved in. In the future, developers will start to realize the strengths of Web3, blockchain, and nfts - like transparency - and the things they
create will start to reflect that.
