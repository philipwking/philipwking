# A couple of weeks ago I was on the floor of the bathroom
in severe digestive distress from some spicy beef and a couple of bao from "Wow Bao" - 
some Uber Eats restuerant that I stumbled upon very late at night. 

It took me a long time to get my money back, find the ghost kitchen's location, and leave a bad review as a warning to other customers.

Now I'm watching a video detailing how these ghost kitchens are rampant with health violations

Are you also tired of the shady practices that sometimes come with ordering food online?
Do you want to support local businesses and talented chefs? 
What if I told you that there's an alternative to ghost kitchens and food delivery apps? 
Introducing delivery-only kitchens, a concept that could revolutionize the food industry.

One of the key advantages of delivery-only kitchens is the ability to save money on staffing and real estate costs. By eliminating the need for a dine-in area, these kitchens can focus solely on preparing high-quality food for delivery. Without the added expense of waitstaff, bussers, and other associated costs, delivery-only kitchens can undercut the prices of their competitors and offer customers more affordable food options.

Another benefit of delivery-only kitchens is the ability to maximize kitchen space. Without the need for a dining area, kitchens can be expanded to accommodate more equipment, ingredients, and staff. This means that chefs can create larger menus with more variety and quality, without the space constraints of a traditional restaurant.

But what about transparency? 
How can customers know what's going on behind the scenes? With delivery-only kitchens, the answer is simple - live streaming. By broadcasting the cooking process, customers can see exactly what's happening in the kitchen, giving them peace of mind and confidence in the quality of their food.

And what if the chefs themselves were the owners of these kitchens? This is where co-op kitchens come in. By providing a space for chefs to work and collaborate, co-op kitchens can help foster a sense of community and entrepreneurship. This model also ensures that the chefs have a vested interest in maintaining the quality of the food and the reputation of the kitchen.

In conclusion, delivery-only kitchens offer a new and exciting alternative to traditional restaurants and food delivery apps. With their cost-saving measures, expanded kitchen space, and transparent cooking process, you will never want to get food poisoning from Mr.Beast Burger again.
