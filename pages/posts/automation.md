# What Will AI Automate First?

We're living in a golden age of automation. And that's not just because we have computers that can do all sorts of things better than humans can—it's also because artificial intelligence (AI) is getting smarter at an exponential rate. Soon enough, AI will be able to automate many jobs that people have traditionally done themselves: writing emails, creating images and videos, composing music...the list goes on! It's going to be pretty overwhelming for humans who work with these technologies every day—but it will also create some very exciting opportunities for them as well. So how does this affect you? What's your role as an employee? An artist? A parent? Here are some ideas about what your job might look like in the future:

### 1. Your email

Email is the most common form of communication, and email automation has been around for years. Mail servers have been automated to the point where they can send emails and receive responses at their own convenience. Email will be automated more and more until it no longer needs to be used by humans at all, but there are still some things that need human input (like responding to customer service inquiries).

### 2. Images

Images are a big part of the user experience and are easy to generate.

Images are generated by a few different resources including crAIyon, Diagram, wombo.ai, and more. 


### 3. Phone calls

In the future, we may see AI-powered call centers that can answer calls and route them to the right person. Imagine being able to talk directly with your doctor or dentist without having to wait on hold for hours and then get transferred between departments as you try to get help.

AI could also be used for customer service issues like detecting when someone is calling from a blocked number or if an online chat session has gone unanswered for too long.

### 4. News and weather reporting

News is already being automated.

Weather is already being automated.

AI will be able to automate a lot of news reporting and weather reporting, which will lead to fewer human reporters on the job. As a result, there will be fewer jobs for journalists—and this is not necessarily a bad thing (though it could be).

### 5. Books

Books will be replaced with audio books, ebooks, and online courses. This is because there are many benefits to reading a book than just the fact that it’s an enjoyable activity in itself. You can learn things from how to build your business or improve your life by reading books. In addition, you can also get inspired from other people's stories who have succeeded at their goals using these different forms of media. For example: if you want to become an entrepreneur then maybe reading about Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg would help inspire you!

### 6. Animation

Animation is a visual medium, which means it's easier to produce and process than audio or text. AI has already been used to generate new images and video, but it will also be used to generate new animations.

AI could be used in film production, animation and game design. The first step is creating a storyboard—a series of drawings that describe what the characters will do and why they're doing it. Then you can use machines learning algorithms like deep learning or convolutional neural nets (CNNs) to create models that can mimic human behavior by mimicking key frames from your original sketches. This allows animators to focus more on making sure their creations look realistic instead of having them learn how each frame should look like before they actually shoot them out onto movie screens around the world!

### 7. Video production, including TV shows and movies

AI will be able to write scripts. AI will be able to generate video content. AI will be able to create video games. AI will be able to create video effects, including the ability for a computer program or algorithm (a neural network) that has been trained with data from other sources such as images and text, then used by humans in their workflows without requiring any human intervention at all!

AI is already being used by companies like Google's DeepMind division which has developed an algorithm called AlphaGo Zero that beat world champion Lee Sedol in three out of five matches during an exhibition match held at Wuzhen International Gaming Competition in China earlier this year before winning against him again later on during another exhibition match held at Guangzhou Universiade Park Stadium over two days back in September 2018; meanwhile Microsoft Research India has also released results showing how they've successfully deployed AI technology into their Azure Machine Learning Platforms thus far resulting in improved accuracy rates compared with traditional methods such as linear regression models which were previously used instead until now."

### 8. Music composition (and music theory)

Music composition is a creative process that requires time, effort and talent. It's more than just writing notes on a page—it's an art form that requires creativity, intuition and skill.

Composing music involves creating melodies, harmonies and rhythms in an effort to create something beautiful or meaningful. If you're not sure what this means: it means you need to think about how your song will sound before you start playing it or singing into your phone microphone (or whatever).

We're going to see a lot of automation in the coming years, and it's going to be pretty overwhelming. But it's also exciting!

The change will affect everyone from CEOs to workers, from doctors and lawyers to farmers, from stock traders and developers—we are all impacted by AI! The fact that this technology has been around for so long means that we've had time to get used to its effects on our lives (and jobs). However, there is one thing we can expect: some people will have trouble adjusting as they lose their jobs or job security; others will have more opportunities than ever before; while some might even make money out of this new world order.

It's hard to predict what will happen exactly with regards to how AI will impact us all; however there are some things we can do right now that might prepare us for any future changes ahead if they occur soon enough (or not!).

Automation is going to change the world. It will create new jobs and opportunities for humans, and it's going to have a profound impact on our lives. But we also need to understand what AI means for us as individuals—because without these skills, we may not be able to keep up with automation.
