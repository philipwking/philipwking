# copy.ai

I must confess! Those last two articles on my blog were not written by me. At least not completely.
I signed up for a free trial of [copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/) and used the blog post generator.
Overall, it was very simple to use and produced pretty good results. I've seen similar experiments before and I am sure I could
have a better result if the artifical intelligence was trained on my writing. 

I did edit the posts to some extent, however, I wanted to keep a few 'artifacts' intact, so that a reader might be able to tell that the articles were
not written by a human. Sort of an 'uncanny valley' for written word. As these tools get more advanced it will become increasingly hard to tell but in my articles 
it is very obvious. 

I forsee an arms race between AI creator tools and AI analyzing tools, where as the creative tools become harder to identify as 'fake', the tools used to analyze
if something is fake will also become more complex. Will we reach a point where users don't know who to trust? This could be an arguement for open source, but even if
everyone can see the code behind this decision of 'what is real', only a small percentage will be able to read it. Maybe we will just have insane code literacy in the
future and the average person will be able to verify these things themselves. 

Ultimately, I believe AI will be a good thing. If its sentient enough to be dangerous, its smart enough to value non-violence. 

I know this post is not as organized or grammatically correct as the ones the AI made for me, but this is my page damn it and I will write whatever I want to. 
Why even worry when I'm the only person who is going to read this. Actually, if you do read this, send me and email real quick at hellophil@philipwking.com with 
the phrase 'Chickachoo chickacheewa' in the body and I'll send
you $1 on CashApp. I'm not rich so I'm only going to do it for the first couple responses.
