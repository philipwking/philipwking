# Why Server Side Rendering Is The Future


Server-side rendering is the future. And not just because it's fun to say, either. It's a powerful technique that can help you create high performance websites and apps, whether you're building a website or application.

### Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a great way to improve your application's performance and style.

Next.js is one of the most popular tools for SSR out there, and is a great choice if you already have experience with React.js.

### SSR improves SEO optimization by enabling search engines to read your page without running Javascript.

Server-side rendering improves SEO optimization by enabling search engines to read your page without running Javascript. This allows them to index and rank you higher in search results, as well as helping users find what they're looking for faster.

Server-side rendering also improves bounce rate, which means that it can improve conversion rates by reducing the number of visitors who leave before converting into customers.

Server-side rendering is a must for any website that wants to rank well in search engines, and it also makes your site more user-friendly by improving load times. 

### With Next.js and Vercel, you can create an application that looks great and is easy to build!

Next.js and Vercel are great together because they make it easy to create server side rendered applications. Check out their documentation for tutorials on how to get started.

I hope this article has helped you understand the benefits of server side rendering, and why it is going to be a vital part of web development in the future. As we mentioned before, with Next.js and Vercel, you can create an application that looks great, is easy to build, and easy to find with a search engine!
